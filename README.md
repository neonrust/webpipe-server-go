# WebPipe - a slim WebSocket library #

A socket.io-like JavaScript library for WebSocket communication.

### Why another? ###

This pretty much sums up my original motivation:

* socket.io 97 kiB  (1.4.5)
* sockjs 57 kiB (1.1.1)
* webpipe **4.3 kiB**

Above sizes are minified.

Also, WebPipe has NO legacy support, or burden depending on how you wish to look at it.

### Dependencies ###

* [gorilla/websocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket)
* Web browser must support [WebSockets](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-sockets.html).
